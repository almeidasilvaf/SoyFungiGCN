Description: This is a Shiny app to explore a gene coexpression network
    inferred from RNA-seq data of soybean tissues infected with
    phytopathogenic fungi. This is a data product resulting from the paper
    "Integration of genome-wide association studies and gene coexpression 
    networks unveils promising soybean resistance genes against five 
    common fungal pathogens".
